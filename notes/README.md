# Notes Directory

This folder is to organize notes, explanations, troubleshooting and reasoning for liking various workflows or applications.

Some of these notes are copied from my Obsidian pkm vault so there might be some frontmatter or other hints of Obsidian.

I know most of this stuff can be easily looked up in the documentation, man pages, or on Google, but I'm a nerd and like taking my own notes for some reason. 🤓
