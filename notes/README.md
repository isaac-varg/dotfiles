# Notes Directory

This folder is to organize notes, explanations, troubleshooting and general knowledge.

This was previously kept in a separate note taking application, but it is better to reference it all in one place. The wiki feature of github was an option but this way grep, fzf, snacks explorer can be easily used.

I know most of this stuff can be easily looked up in the documentation, man pages, or on Google, but I'm a nerd and like taking my own notes for some reason.
